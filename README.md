# Final-Project_CMPS451

This uses ten epochs to go over 170,000 pairs of words/sentences, so it may take a while depending on your hardware. 
For reference, a laptop with an RTX 3070 took around 45 minutes to train the model.
However, as it trains the model, it saves it in the Outputs directory, and after running it once, it will load the saved model in future uses.
You can retrain it if you want, just use the normal run command and then add "--retrain" at the end of it.
